A series of blog posts on Intrade, a prediction market. Combining portfolio simulation with the prediction market, I got a responsive, dynamic, and accurate predictor of the race.

[Mathematica Code](https://github.com/CodyStumpo/Intrade_Pres_Election2008) for the model and blog.

With my friend [Daniel Reeves](https://github.com/dreeves), we also got it to publish [live updates](https://github.com/dreeves/pollsim). Since Intrade is out of business (because regulators) the blog posts themselves are not well-archived but are self-archived [here](https://github.com/CodyStumpo/CodyStumpo.github.io/blob/master/files/Intrade%20Columns.pdf)
