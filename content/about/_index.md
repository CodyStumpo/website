I've done a lot of things in a lot of places. This website is focused on my projects. Every so often, I get the itch to make something. There's two kinds of things I make that translate well to the web. One is music, and the other is analytics. 

## Music

I've been playing music since I was about 6 years old. I've been in dozens of bands and played hundreds of gigs. Some of them were really good! I got lucky to record some of it, which you can hear through this site.


## Analytics

I majored in math and while I sometimes do love the abstract beauty of it, I mostly do projects around applied data analysis.  There's a few problem areas I keep returning to - baseball and risk management. You'll see a lot of that as the material I use to keep current in machine learning and R and so on.
